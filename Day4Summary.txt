Day4:


1) DDL Commands: (DDL - Data Definition Language)
Cannot be Rolled Back

- CREATE
- ALTER
- DROP
- TRUNCATE


2) DML Commands: (DML - Data Manipulation Language)
These commands can be rolled back when autocommit is in manual mode i.e. set autocommit = 0;

- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE

3) DCL Commands: (DCL - Data Control Language)

- COMMIT (make permanent changes)
- ROLLBACK (undo commands)
- SAVEPOINT



All DDL commands work as an Implicit Commit. So if a DDL command is encountered in between it will implicitly be commit
Even all savepoints will go and the mode also automatically changes to 'automatic commit mode'

Queries Learnt

- LIKE
- AS
- SET
- WHERE -- rows based on condition
- IN used for multiple criterias (multiple ORs not for ANDs) 
- NOT IN - works reverse of IN and excluding the mentioned criterias
- IS is used with null
- IS NOT
- BETWEEN



Creating copy of the table with data (but without keys/constraints)
CREATE TABLE newauthor as SELECT * from author;

Creating copy of the table only the structure (but with keys/constraints)
create table author1 LIKE author;



Rollbacks undos all the DML commands and only the immediate previous one


Savepoint

savepoint one
update author1 set authorname = 'Chandbibi', where authorid = 'A001';

savepoint two
insert into author1 values('A006','Ashwini Bhatt','India', 'M');

savepoint three;
delete from author1 where authorid = 'A004';



* - means all rows, all columns



----------------------------------
APPROXIMATION

Wildcard characters
% - this search is based on charaters
_ - this search is based on length


- LIKE
- NOT LIKE
- ORDER BY (Ascending)
- ORDER BY ... DESC (Descending)
- LIMIT

Joining Tables
 Here the 'Foreign Key' helps in achieveing this

1. Basic joining (SIMPLE JOIN, EQUIJOIN, PERFECT JOIN)
2. Using JOIN and ON
Working of JOIN, LEFT JOIN (means all the data from the left table), RIGHT JOIN (means all the data from the right table)
And wherever there is not data found NULL is put there
3. SELF JOIN
